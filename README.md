# 북진! (Book-jin, meaning "Advance North") [Our Salute]

## Welcome to "My Military Journey"!
I'm currently on a two-year leave of absence to serve in the Korean military. I'm currently a combat engineer (private) at the Republic of Korea Special Warfare Command (Special Forces). In order to keep track of myself, I decided to create a repository in hopes of not losing touch with Github & Coding. I'll use this as a monorepo to store all my projects I started in the military.

## Military Stats:
- Graduated basic training with honors, placing 10/232 students / aspiring soldiers
- Received additional training on Close Quarters Combat (CQB) and Individual Combat Training
- Created an internal software to streamline handling classified documents and tracking brigade materials
